# Piano App

## Project Overview

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - Piano App, created using PyQt6, PyQtmultimedia, and Pygame! This app is designed to be a fun and educational tool for those who aspire to learn and explore both music and coding. By mapping computer keyboard keys to piano notes, the app provides an intuitive way to play and learn piano melodies.

### Key Features

- **Major Notes Mapping**: Keys A to J on the computer keyboard correspond to the major notes on the piano (usually white keys).
- **Sharp Notes Integration**: Keys W to I are mapped to the sharp notes (usually black keys), allowing users to easily switch between major and sharp notes.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Piano App, follow these steps to clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JayKareliya-code/Piano-App.git
    cd piano-app
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

    - On Windows:

      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the App**

    Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Piano App:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Requirements

Ensure the following libraries are included in your `requirements.txt` file:
* PyQt6
* pygame
